Enhanced Focus States:
Focus and hover states are designed to provide clear visual feedback.
Minimum Touch Target Sizing:
Interactive elements meet the recommended 44px minimum for touch targets.
Reduced Motion Preferences:
A media query for prefers-reduced-motion: reduce disables long animations for users who prefer minimal motion.
